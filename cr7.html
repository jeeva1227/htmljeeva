Cristiano Ronaldo is a part of Real Madrid's legacy and will forever be remember as one of the great icons throughout the club's history. He was unveiled at the Santiago Bernabéu on 6 July 2009, where he was joined by Eusebio and Alfredo Di Stéfano, and since that day, the goals just kept coming. He netted 451 times in 438 competitive appearances with Real Madrid (averaging over a goal a game). He registered in all of the competitions he featured in: 312 in LaLiga, 105 in the Champions League, 22 in the Copa del Rey, six in the Club World Cup, four in the Spanish Super Cup and two in the UEFA Super Cup.

    So, as it stands, Ronaldo is set to play on for a fourth year in Turin.

Since joining Juve from Real Madrid in a €100 million transfer in 2018, Ronaldo has continued to produce some impressive goalscoring statistics.

Now 36, Ronaldo – who has also previously played for Sporting CP and Manchester United - remains one of the most prolific players in world football.

As yet, though, he has not been able to fire Juve to Champions League glory, which was undoubtedly a key goal as he entered the 2021-22 campaign.

This page will be regularly updated to showcase Ronaldo’s individual club statistics for Juventus throughout the season.
